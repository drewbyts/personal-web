Hello! My name is Andrew and I'm currently a research data analyst at the California Lottery.
I've pioneered the development of regression models for the organization, created dashboards to improve the throughput of units, and written organizational reports that 
will net the Lottery approximately $ 1 Million in annual savings. 
Additionally, I was nominated for the organization's Superior Accomplishment Award. 

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing tennis with friends, going to the gym, and learning new things. I'm always immersing myself into new subjects. 
Whether it's learning how to create web apps, creating art through data visualizations, or shooting photography, I want to stay engaged while adding my spark to everything I do.  

I recently started a newsletter where I share what I like to call, "byts" of research. In that newsletter, I dive into 
analyzing ideas, phenomenon, and trends in what many are dubbing, the Creator Economy.
