#### Background:

I live in Sacramento and plenty of neighborhood cats stroll into my backyard. While observing the cats, I had a question.

#### Question: 

How did shelters in Sacramento fare in 2020?

#### Action:       

To answer that, I took to City of Sacramento datsets.

I created visualizations to illustrate how animals——and how many animals——ended up
in shelters, the color of the animals admitted, and type of animal (i.e cat or dog) most commonly admitted. The analysis is compiled below.
